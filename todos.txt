2.x

- example for generating any kind of gradient with specific colors
- utility function to draw stuff on canvas (colorutil.rgb.draw(gradientOptions), colorutil.hsl.draw...)
- optimize gradients
- docs
- set verify to true
- cssrgb etc gradient. what does that mean??
- repeat.invert
- document rotation center behavior on scaling (+translate??)
- take transformations apart from the gradients and cache some of the calculations
- optimise cache and compare benchmark
    - by not throwing away the converted colors in when converting long color path
    - by utilizing existing cache when converting colors
- hueFromColor hueFromValue add similar for each color components: s l v a r g b and think about the naming
    - setR(), setA(), setH(), setL()
    - setRed(), setAlpha(), setHue(), setLightness()
- color mix. functionality is basically there already

Maybe
- public function determining whether data is matrix (colorutil.isMatrix)
- radius for circle gradients. undefined = no radius. out of radius values are transparent
    - the outer edges are pretty rough they need anoter way to clean them
    - maybe allow radius with draw function to prevent unnecessary dawing and use globalCompositeOperation to clean edges.
- circleMatrixColor by radius and distance instead of x & y
- maybe a shortcut method for getting the grayscale matrix (white, black, hue)
- maybe provide validation and input patterns
